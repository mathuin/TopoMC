The NED provides the best available public domain raster elevation data of the conterminous United States, Alaska, Hawaii, and territorial islands in a seamless format.  The NED is derived from diverse source data, processed to a common coordinate system and unit of vertical measure.  All NED data are distributed in geographic coordinates in units of decimal degrees, and in conformance with the North American Datum of 1983 (NAD 83).  All elevation values are provided in units of meters, and are referenced to the North American Vertical Datum of 1988 (NAVD 88) over the conterminous United States.  The vertical reference will vary in other areas.  NED data are available nationally at resolutions of 1 arc-second (approx. 30 meters) and 1/3 arc-second (approx. 10 meters), and in limited areas at 1/9 arc-second (approx. 3 meters).  At present, the bulk of Alaska is only available at a 2 arc-second (approx. 60 meters) resolution, owing to a lack of higher resolution source data, though some areas are available at resolutions of 1 and 1/3 arc-second with plans for significant upgrades of the state over the next five years.  The NED is updated on a nominal two month cycle to integrate newly available, improved elevation source data.</abstract><purpose>The NED serves as the elevation layer of The National Map, and provides basic elevation information for earth science studies and mapping applications in the United States.  The data are utilized by the scientific and resource management communities for global change research, hydrologic modeling, resource monitoring, mapping and visualization applications.</purpose><supplinf>The data obtained through The National Map Seamless Server is considered to be the "best available" data from the USGS. The range of dates for the NED 1-arc second data cover the inception date of the dataset to the date of the most recent update.

The selection of source data is accomplished by an automated query of a database of USGS and partner-supplied DEMs.  The "best available" data criteria are applied to select specific file-based DEMs from the database.  The headers of the selected DEMs are read to create an index, which controls production and triggers subsequent processing steps.  Industry standard tools from the National Geodetic Survey, NADCON and VERTCON, are used to perform horizontal and vertical datum transformations, respectively.The source DEMs are projected from their native coordinate system to a geographic coordinate system (decimal degrees of latitude and longitude) using standard cartographic transformation software.  Resampling of the original elevation values is done with an implementation of cubic convolution that is optimized for elevation data by maintaining the integrity of shorelines and water bodies.  Artifact removal is performed on the older USGS Level 1 DEMs that were produced with photogrammetric methods.  The "mean profile filter" was specifically designed to process these 7.5-minute DEMs.  The filter process uses a series of directional filters to isolate the high-frequency artifacts, which are then subtracted from the DEM.  The magnitude of these artifacts is small, typically less than 1 meter, so the change to the DEM is negligible, but the removal results in significant improvements in derivative elevation products, such as shaded relief, slope, and aspectThe final steps in the production process include paneling the DEMs to fill the 1- by 1-degree tile, filling slivers of missing data along DEM boundaries as necessary by interpolating adjacent values, and edge matching the seams along the DEM boundaries and tile edges.  The edge match algorithm uses a feathering approach that maintains local slope continuity across the seam. Finally, a shaded-relief image of the tile is generated for inspection by an analyst to verify successful processing, especially artifact filtering and edge matching.  In some cases, DEM header information, which automatically triggers certain processing options, is incorrect, and the result is data that are not acceptable for inclusion into the NED.  These cases are detected in the visual inspection step, the DEM header is corrected, and the tile is submitted for reprocessing.  Tiles passing inspection are transferred to the next release version, and the spatially referenced metadata are updated accordingly.The metadata were created for display through The National Map Seamless Server at http://seamless.usgs.gov, and are available in several formats: HTML, TEXT, XML, FAQ and SGML.</procdesc><procdate>Ongoing</procdate><proccont><cntinfo><cntorgp><cntorg>U.S. Geological Survey</cntorg></cntorgp><cntpos>Customer Service Representative</cntpos><cntaddr><addrtype>mailing and physical address</addrtype><address>USGS Earth Resources Observation &amp; Science (EROS) Center</address><address>47914 252nd Street</address><city>Sioux Falls</city><state>SD</state><postal>57198-0001</postal><country>USA</country></cntaddr><cntvoice>605-594-6151</cntvoice><cntvoice>1-800-252-4547</cntvoice><cnttdd>605-594-6933</cnttdd><cntfax>605-594-6589</cntfax><cntemail>custserv@usgs.gov</cntemail><hours>0800 - 1600 CT, M - F (-6h CST/-5h CDT GMT)</hours></cntinfo></proccont></procstep></lineage></dataqual><spdoinfo><direct>Raster</direct><rastinfo><rasttype>Pixel</rasttype><rowcount>342</rowcount><colcount>289</colcount><vrtcount>1</vrtcount></rastinfo></spdoinfo><spref><horizsys><geograph><latres>0.00001</latres><longres>0.00001</longres><geogunit>Decimal degrees</geogunit></geograph><geodetic><horizdn>North American Datum of 1983</horizdn><ellips>Geodetic Reference System 80</ellips><semiaxis>6378137.000000</semiaxis><denflat>298.257222</denflat></geodetic></horizsys><vertdef><altsys><altdatum>North American Vertical Datum of 1988</altdatum><altres>1.000000</altres><altunits>meters</altunits><altenc>Implicit coordinate</altenc></altsys></vertdef></spref><eainfo><overview><eadetcit>A link to the NED Data Dictionary describing information that is included in the spatial metadata shapefiles acquired with the DEM is provided at the end of the Metadata Section of this document.</eadetcit></overview></eainfo><distinfo><distrib><cntinfo><cntorgp><cntorg>U.S. Geological Survey</cntorg></cntorgp><cntpos>Customer Service Representative</cntpos><cntaddr><addrtype>mailing and physical address</addrtype><address>USGS Earth Resources Observation &amp; Science (EROS) Center</address><address>47914 252nd Street</address><city>Sioux Falls</city><state>SD</state><postal>57198-0001</postal><country>USA</country></cntaddr><cntvoice>605-594-6151</cntvoice><cntvoice>1-800-252-4547</cntvoice><cnttdd>605-594-6933</cnttdd><cntfax>605-594-6589</cntfax><cntemail>custserv@usgs.gov</cntemail><hours>0800 - 1600 CT, M - F (-6h CST/-5h CDT GMT)</hours></cntinfo></distrib><resdesc>Downloadable Data</resdesc><distliab>Although these data have been processed successfully on a computer system at the USGS, no warranty expressed or implied is made by the USGS regarding the use of the data on any other system, nor does the act of distribution constitute any such warranty.
